<h2 id="marshmallow-challenge">Marshmallow Challenge</h2>

<p>Recently, I had a marshmallow challenge with a number of new colleges and the result impressed me a little bit. </p>

<p>The challenge involves a small group of people who were asked to use spaghetti, tape and a string to construct a structure which is supposed to hold a marshmallow. It is a time boxed task and the success is measured by the height of the structure excluding the marshmallow itself. Below is an image that would give you an good idea: <br>

<p>When we were assigned the task, it appeared firstly a very simple task. The only question was how to make the structure as high as possible. And the end result for our team and for all three team in the challenge is:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code class=" hljs livecodeserver"><span class="hljs-constant">zero</span> inches</code></pre>

<p><em>None of our structures actually stood. They all fell down badly. </em></p>

<p>And here is what happened to our team. We spent around 4 minutes to discuss the strategies:</p>

<ul>
<li>We cut all the spaghetti to half so we thought we would make good use of them. </li>
<li>One person would also be cut the tap into pieces so that we <br>
thought we would make full use of them. </li>
<li>We decided to try a triangle shape.</li>
</ul>

<p>And it turned out that either of them worked. The triangle couldn’t stand well. The tape was too small. The shorter spaghetti didn’t help either. When it came to the end, we rushed to put the marshmallow onto a poorly structured architecture and it collapsed.. Oops</p>

<p>We were told later that preschoolers actually do this better than adults and the key is to <strong>try</strong> and <strong>adjust</strong>. Preschoolers tends to just try. They put marshmallow on top of the structure as early as possible rather than at the <strong>end</strong>. The lesson wasn’t obvious but makes a lot of sense when your structure couldn’t even stand.</p>

<p>From a broader point of view, the implication can be applied to other things. How many times have we seen a project fails with <strong>great</strong> plan? <strong>Try</strong> and receive <strong>constant</strong> feedback from what you have done, <strong>reflect</strong> what worked and what didn’t work and <strong>adjust</strong> what you will be doing can indeed help us getting closer to what we want. I think in the end, this is what is called <strong>agile</strong>.</p>

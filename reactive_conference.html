<h1>Reactive Conference</h1>

<p>Last week, I attended the reactive conference <a href="http://reactconf.com/">http://reactconf.com/</a> in San Francisco. Here are the session details in case anyone is interested.</p>

<p>For those who knows little about Reactive Programming, below are some good references to begin with:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/">Reactive Manifesto</a></li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/reactive-programming/what-is-reactive-programming-bc9fa7f4a7fc">What is Reactive Programming</a></li>
</ul>


<h3>Day 1</h3>

<p>There are 6 sessions in day 1 (Nov 18th).</p>

<h4>Subjectively consistent</h4>

<p>The first session is from <strong>Pat Helland</strong>, a microsoft veteran and is now working for salesforce.</p>

<p>In the session, he talks about what is subjectively consistent and the concept of ACID 2.0 (A for Associative, C for Commutative, I for Idempotent and D for Distributed).
I was not able to find any ppt or video for the talk. But you can read this <a href="http://www-db.cs.wisc.edu/cidr/cidr2009/Paper_133.pdf">paper</a> to get some idea.</p>

<h4>Responding in a Timely Manner</h4>

<p>The second session is from <strong>Martin Thompson</strong> who was the co-founder and CTO of LMAX, a FX trading platform.</p>

<p>In this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dfk3ucthN8&amp;list=PLSD48HvrE7-Z1stQ1vIIBumB0wK0s8llY&amp;index=3">presentation</a>, Martin Thompson talks about how to test/measure response time. One of the idea is that we should use percentile to measure response time instead of averages. After that he talks about some theory like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queueing_theory">queuing theory</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl's_law">Amdahl's Law</a>, <a href="http://www.perfdynamics.com/Manifesto/USLscalability.html">Universal Scalability Law</a>. He then goes through a practical example. In the end, he mentions several techniques like <a href="http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com/2011/10/smart-batching.html">Smart batching</a>, <a href="http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com/2012/05/apply-back-pressure-when-overloaded.html">Applying backpressue</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-blocking_algorithm">non blocking design</a>, <a href="http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com/2013/08/lock-based-vs-lock-free-concurrent.html">lock free concurrent algorithm</a> and Observable State Machines.</p>

<h4>Resilient by Design</h4>

<p>The third session is from <strong>Ben Christensen</strong> from Netfix.</p>

<p>In the talk, Ben talks about why Resilient Design is required in Netflix and how <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix">Hystrix</a> tries to resolve the issue. Fault Tolerance is not <strong><em> exception handling </em></strong>, it is daily life. A disaster in a system may not from a critical error but from the effect of small errors joining together. There should be a systematic way to avoid that.</p>

<h4>Elastic Scaling</h4>

<p>The fourth session is from <strong>Benjamin Hindman</strong>, the co-creator of <a href="http://mesos.apache.org/">Apache Mesos</a> and worked for twitter.</p>

<p>As the creator of Apache Mesos, he talks about how to dynamically provision and un-provision resources to make your application scale. Apache Mesos abstracts the computer resources such as cpu, memory, storage etc to make elastic scaling easier and more effective.</p>

<h4>To Be Message-Driven</h4>

<p>The fifth session is from <strong>Todd Montomery</strong>.</p>

<p>In the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/toddleemontgomery/reactsf-2014messagedriven">presentation</a>, he talks about why message driven is a key part of reactive programming. With message driven, first, the boundary between components is harder to couple and conflate, second, the asynchronous processing means you can do stuff while waiting. He also mentions the ordering is an illusion. Thus system should be designed to be idempotent so there is little ordering or state requirement.</p>

<h4>Understanding Latency</h4>

<p>The last session in Day 1 is from <strong>Gil Tene</strong>, who is the founder of Azul Systems.</p>

<p>In the talk, he discussed some of key lessons and tools that can help us to understand how the system performs, like <a href="https://github.com/HdrHistogram/HdrHistogram">HdrHistogram</a> and <a href="https://github.com/giltene/jHiccup">jHiccup</a>.
Here is a similar Qcon <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/latency-lessons-tools">talk</a>.</p>

<h3>Day 2</h3>

<p>There are another 6 sessions in day 2 (Nov 19).</p>

<h4>Life Beyond the Illusion of Present</h4>

<p>The first session in Day 2 is from <strong>Jonas Boner</strong>, who is the CTO and co-founder of typesafe and was creator of akka actor.</p>

<p>He talks about using time as first class memeber in programming and mentions that <strong>relying</strong> on timestamp in your application logic is a bad idea. CRUD is dead. There should be no update or delete but only create and read.</p>

<h4>Event Processing: Making sense of the fire-hose in real-time</h4>

<p>The second session is from <strong> Andy Piper </strong>.</p>

<p>In the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/AndyPiper1/reactconf-2014-event-stream-processing">Presentation</a>, Andy Piper talks about Event Stream Processing (ESP). He tries to answer the following questions: what is ESP? Why it is needed? What does it look like? And the design considerations like performance (needs to be fast), resiliency, scalability and distribution. In the end, he mentions fast data architecture and several technologies like Apache Storm, Spark, Kafaka, etc.</p>

<h4>Reactive, Event Driven User Interfaces</h4>

<p>The third one is from <strong>Lee Campbell</strong> and <strong>Matt Barrett</strong>.</p>

<p>In the session, they demonstrated a currency trading application using reactive principles. They discussed the four challenges for UI applications: responsive, resilient, latency and consistent and the techniques to overcome these challenges, like embracing non blocking, using asynchrony, everything is a stream, favoring functional data models, etc.
Here is the <a href="http://weareadaptive.com/blog/2014/04/12/reactconf-2014-reactive-ui/">blog</a>. They also open sourced the application they developed in <a href="https://github.com/AdaptiveConsulting/ReactiveTrader">github</a>.</p>

<h4>Error handling in Reactive Systems.</h4>

<p>This fourth session is from <strong> Dean Wampler </strong>.</p>

<p>In this <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/deanwampler/error-handling-in-reactive-systems">presentation</a>, Dean Wampler thinks "Failure" should be a first class member. He mentions a number of ways to do failure handling, like the most common failure handling mixed with domain logic to actor's "let it crash" way. He also compares CSP (communicating sequential process, examples like Go &amp; Clojure's core.async) and Actor and concludes that they can implement each other although they appear different. In the end, he tries to response some criticisms on actor.</p>

<h4>Reactive Storage</h4>

<p>The fifth session is from <strong> Andrew Stewart </strong> .</p>

<p>In the talk, he talks about different strategies for different data characteristics, like early life, post-mortem, historic and difficult. He mentions the usage of <a href="https://github.com/google/leveldb">leveldb</a>. The San Francisco conference video hasn't been uploaded yet but here is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJkW4Clipd8">video</a> from London conference if you want to take a look.</p>

<h4>Closing Keynote - Who Builds a Skyscraper without Drawing Blueprints?</h4>

<p>The closing session is from <strong>Leslie Lamport</strong>, who is famous for <strong> Lamport clock</strong>. He talked about using <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/tla.html">TLA+</a> to verify the correctness of your program after the design and <strong> before </strong> writing code. Is <strong> formal method </strong> too academic and costly for real world systems? It may be not, check this <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/formal-methods-amazon.pdf">article</a> from amazon AWS team on how they use TLA+ for their real production systems, like Dynamodb.</p>
